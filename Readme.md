### Improvements (pros and cons)
- During this session there are a lot of tradeofs have been made due to time consrtaints 
- Save varibles in .env file, but since I am sharing the full code, I would just add it in the config file ü§∑
- Search only on button tap and do not send request every single time, saves a lot of üí∏
- I would add Context api or Redux to manage state a bit better instead of props drilling(ex. onBusinessTap)
- Map Autofocus on location update
- Error, loading, state handling
- On deatils screen review as a list
- Add tests, because we ‚ù§Ô∏è tests =)
